### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my world, my name is Gerry Tonnoto. My friends always call me gerry. I'm 21 years old and still studying at Bunda Mulia University as computer science. In daily life, I really like playing games. So that it can be said as my hobby besides exercising..  
my favorite programming languages are C++ and javascript. but now, I'm more focused on learning darts and java script. i'm always interested with how to make an application. that so why i'm take computer science for my study in my collage.
